This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (“Personal Information”) on the inside-out-d0bd8.web.app website (“Website”), “Inside out” mobile application (“Mobile Application”), and any of their related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.\n\nThis Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator and Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Services. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.\n\n[Collection of personal information](B)\n\nYou can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered on the Services, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).\n\nWe receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account,  or fill any forms on the Services. When required, this information may include sensitive personal information (such as ethnicity, religious beliefs, mental health, etc).\n\nYou can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.\n\n[Privacy of children](B)\n\nWe do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.\n\nWe encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.\n\n[Use and processing of collected information](B)\n\nWe act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.\n\nOur role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.\n\nWe act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.\n\nIn order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:\n\n- Create and manage user accounts\n- Run and operate the Services\n\nProcessing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.\n\nNote that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.\n\n[Managing information](B)\n\nYou are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account on the Services.\n\n[Disclosure of information](B)\n\nTo maintain the highest level of privacy and to protect your Personal Information to the full extent, we do not share your Personal Information with anyone and for any reason.\n\n[Retention of information](B)\n\nWe will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary as long as your user account remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n\nWe may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.\n\n[Do Not Track signals](B)\n\nSome browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information. For a description of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices or to learn more about the choices available to you, visit internetcookies.com\n\n[Links to other resources](B)\n\nThe Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.\n\n[Information security](B)\n\nWe secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.\n\nAs the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security of the device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your credentials, please take appropriate measures to protect this information.\n\n[Data breach](B)\n\nIn the event we become aware that the security of the Services has been compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.\n\n[Changes and amendments](B)\n\nWe reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.\n\nAn updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.\n\n[Acceptance of this policy](B)\n\nYou acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Services and submitting your information you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Services. This privacy policy was created with the help of https://www.websitepolicies.com/privacy-policy-generator\n\n[Contacting us](B)\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Policy, the information we hold about you, or if you wish to exercise your rights, we encourage you to contact us using the details below:\n\n[miriam.app.service@gmail.com](I)\n\nWe will attempt to resolve complaints and disputes and make every reasonable effort to honor your wish to exercise your rights as quickly as possible and in any event, within the timescales provided by applicable data protection laws.\n\nThis document was last updated on June 13, 2023",

We can also know their most frequent secondary and tertiary feelings, although these depend on culture, gender, ethnicity, social class and the time in which you are, therefore, these are constantly changing. In addition, for each core emotion each person experiences different behaviours and bodily sensations, that is, for each basic emotion we have a habitual form of behaviour and experience a set of sensations. A clear example of behaviour would be the paralysis of the body in a situation of fear and a clear example of bodily sensation could be the increase in temperature or clenching the teeth in a situation of anger. Having knowledge and classifying the behaviours and bodily sensations that we express for each basic emotion makes it easier for us to identify the core feeling that we are experiencing at that moment",
  "primary_emotions_text2": "We call this image [the wheel of emotions](B). It gives us a clear view of the primary, secondary and tertiary emotions.\n\nWe can identify that it is divided by sections and that each section belongs to a basic emotion or a set of them. In the inner central part we have 6 emotions, our 4 core feelings and as additions [surprise](B) and [disgust](B). We will understand surprise as the intersection between fear and happiness, and disgust as the intersection between sadness and anger. We can understand the secondary or tertiary emotions as derivation of the primary ones. Tertiary feelings are the most conventional in defining a mood and help us to differentiate why we feel that emotion, they are the ones found on the outside of the wheel. Secondary feelings are a further layer of abstraction that helps us to classify and understand the primary feeling and the possible reason for it, they are positioned on the second circumference.\n\nThis wheel facilitates the recognition of the primary emotion we are experiencing at any given moment." ,
  "anger_text": "In the case of [rage](B) or [anger](B), the thought is positioned in the present and serves to avoid the transgression of limits, i.e., we feel anger at an immediate or nearby event and we express it to reflect that this event should not happen again.\n\nA practical case that helps socialisation is the identification of an individual's anger with us, a reaction to an act or event of acts that we have carried out. The person indicates us that what we have done does not like or does not seem good to him/her and we should not repeat it with him/her.\n\nThe most frequent tertiary and secondary feelings are [frustration](I), [impotence](I), [anger](I) and [resentment](I)",
